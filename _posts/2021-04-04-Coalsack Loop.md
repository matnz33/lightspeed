Coalsack Loop

A stellar association is a loose star cluster where the stars are thought to share a common origin, have become unbound from each other but are still moving together through space. OB associations are, as the name suggests, associations where the stars are young and contain 10-100 massive stars of spectral type O and B.  In addition to these OB stars they also contain thousands of smaller mass stars. Between Centaurus and Crux there exists an OB association which represents one of the most prominent star- forming regions of the Milky Way.  We are all familiar with some of the associations more famous members which form the Southern cross and also NGC 4755 or the jewel box cluster.  The area also contains the well known dark nebula, the CoalSack. Of particular interest to me, a major feature of the Centaurus OB association is the presence of a hydrogen super shell, the Coalsack Loop, which spans 10 degrees in size.

The coalsack Loop was first reported by Walker & Zealey in 1998, and at that time they though this shell was most likely the expanding remains of an old supernova remnant.  However the location of the OB association with the shell, and similarities between the shell shape and OB star distribution strongly suggests an interaction of the OB association stellar winds and the shell material. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the OB stars contribute enough wind injection to explain the size and expansion velocity of the shell.

Given its size there are very few images of the coalsack Loop, however John Gleason has done a great Ha mosaic of this area.
